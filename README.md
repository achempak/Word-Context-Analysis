# Word-Context-Analysis
Provide analysis of words based on the context that they appear in. Takes in a corpus as an input and uses dimensionality reduction and 
clustering to produce groups of words in the input corpus that have similar contextual meaning. These meanings may vary from corpus 
to corpus. A nearest neighbor search can be performed on any of the words in the modified dataset of words to find the words that 
have the most similar meaning (again, in terms of the surrounding context) to the query word.
